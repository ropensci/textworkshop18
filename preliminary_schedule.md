## Roundtables

The idea of a roundtable is to get a set of 3-6 people working a lot in this area to identify the issues, spark a discussion and debate to identify the issues, and get the conversation flowing.  From these will arise points to work on in Day 2.  Everyone is assigned somewhere.

**Chairs:** We could ask one participant to lead discussion in each session.
